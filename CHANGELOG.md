# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. Format is loosely [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)-style, adapted for a rolling-release OS built phase by phase rather than a semantically-versioned library: entries are grouped by roadmap phase (see `docs/ROADMAP.md`), newest first. This file is updated as part of every meaningful change, not as an afterthought — see `CLAUDE.md`'s Documentation Map.

## [Unreleased] — Phase 4: CLI, pure REST API client

### Added
- `client/`: `kx_client_request()` — a reusable HTTP client library for talking to the Kanxeo API, extracted from `test_daemon.c`'s ad hoc socket code so `kanxeoctl` and the test suite share one implementation instead of two. Its response buffer is dynamically-growing (no fixed size cap), unlike the test code it replaced.
- `cli/`: `kanxeoctl` — the CLI, one subcommand per endpoint (`health`, `ps`, `run`, `inspect`, `rm`), zero direct runtime access. `--json` for raw output; formatted text by default. Exit codes: `0`/`1`/`2` (success/API-or-transport-failure/usage-error).
- `test/test_image_fixture.c`: shared test-image staging, factored out of `test_daemon.c` so `test_cli.c` doesn't duplicate it.
- `test/test_cli.c`: end-to-end verification driving the real `kanxeoctl` binary as a subprocess.
- `docs/adr/0009-cloexec-daemon-fds-before-clone3.md`.

### Changed
- `test/test_daemon.c`: refactored to use `client/src/httpclient.c` and `test/test_image_fixture.c` instead of its own duplicated logic — same 9 assertions, no behavior change.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: Phase 4 marked done; locked-in decisions gained the CLOEXEC rule.

### Fixed
- **Every `POST /v1/containers` request silently stalled for as long as the created container ran** (discovered as `test_daemon.c` taking ~30s instead of milliseconds, under the same repeated-run stress-testing discipline that caught the Phase 3 `epoll_event` bug). Root cause: none of the daemon's own fds (listening socket, accepted client sockets, `epoll` fd, cgroup `O_PATH` fd) were `CLOEXEC`, so every `clone3()`'d container inherited a duplicate of the triggering client connection, and the kernel withholds EOF on a TCP connection until every reference to it — across every process — closes. Fixed by creating every one of those fds `CLOEXEC` from the start (`SOCK_CLOEXEC`/`EPOLL_CLOEXEC`/`O_CLOEXEC`). See ADR-0009. Verified by timing: ~30s → ~0.3s per `test_daemon.c` run.

## Phase 3: REST API spec + daemon

### Added
- `docs/api/openapi.yaml`: the versioned REST API contract (health check, container CRUD), written before any handler code — see ADR-0006.
- `daemon/`: the REST daemon (`kanxeod`) — a hand-rolled, single-threaded, `epoll`-driven HTTP/1.1 + JSON reactor with an in-memory container registry, implementing that contract. See ADR-0005 and ADR-0007.
- `struct kx_epoll_event` / `kx_epoll_ctl()` / `kx_epoll_wait()` in `include/linux_compat.h`.
- `test/test_daemon.c` + `test/daemon_child.c`: end-to-end verification driving the daemon over real HTTP.
- `docs/adr/`: Architecture Decision Records (0000–0008), covering every significant decision made so far, not just this phase's.
- `docs/api/README.md`: human-oriented quick reference alongside the authoritative OpenAPI spec.
- This file.

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md`: added the API-First Mandate (the daemon is the only process with direct runtime access; CLI/web are pure API clients) and a Documentation Map.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: Phase 3 re-scoped from "minimal container CLI" to "REST API spec + daemon," and Phases 4/5 split into CLI and web dashboard, both now depending on Phase 3 instead of the runtime library directly.
- `include/linux_compat.h`: all epoll usage across the daemon now goes through `kx_epoll_event`, never the system `struct epoll_event`.

### Fixed
- **`epoll_ctl()`/`epoll_wait()` silently corrupting their `data` field under TCC**, causing an intermittent (~50–60% of runs) segfault on the very first request. Root cause: TCC ignores `__attribute__((packed))` entirely, so the kernel's 12-byte `struct epoll_event` ABI was being compiled as 16 bytes. See ADR-0008.

## Phase 2 — OverlayFS root construction

### Added
- `docs/MISSION.md` (verbatim charter), `docs/ROADMAP.md` (phase-by-phase status), `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded project instructions).
- `struct overlay_spec` + `overlay_create()` (`include/container.h` / `src/overlay.c`): real OverlayFS layering (lowerdir/upperdir/workdir), replacing Phase 1's bind-mount-of-live-host-root. See ADR-0004.
- `mountns_make_private()`, split out of `mountns_pivot()` so mount-propagation is privatized before the overlay mount, not after.
- `test/test_overlay.c` + `test/overlay_child.c`.
- `README.md`.

### Changed
- `struct mount_spec`: `root_source` removed (folded into `overlay_spec.merged`) to eliminate a duplicate-state footgun.
- `mountns_pivot()` no longer populates the root itself; it only requires the root already be a mount point.
- `test/test_harness.c` updated to route through `overlay_create()` (`lowerdir="/"`, preserving its original full-host-visible behavior) and to read its result file from upperdir's copy-up path instead of the bare host path.

## Phase 0 + Phase 1 — Toolchain smoke test, namespace + cgroup v2 container harness

### Added
- `test/test_toolchain.c`: confirms TCC compiles and dynamically links against host glibc, and every header family later phases need parses clean. See ADR-0001.
- `include/container.h`, `include/linux_compat.h`, `include/internal.h`, `src/cgroup.c`, `src/ns_create.c`, `src/mountns.c`, `src/container.c`: the container runtime library — `clone3`-based namespace creation with atomic cgroup v2 placement, mount-namespace pivot, pidfd-based reaping. See ADR-0002, ADR-0003.
- `test/test_harness.c` + `test/harness_child.c`.
- `Makefile`, `.gitignore`, initial repository scaffold.

### Notes
- Requires a **privileged** LXC container/host to run — an unprivileged nested LXC blocks the final `mount("proc", ...)` with `EPERM`/"VFS: Mount too revealing" regardless of mount flags or namespace combination tried (confirmed by elimination during this phase).
