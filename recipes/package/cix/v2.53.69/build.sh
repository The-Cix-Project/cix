#
# v2.53.69 -- ADR-0249 up to seventeen handler modules.
#
# network (creating virtual networks, their ports, attaching and
# detaching real host interfaces) brings it to seventeen. main.c
# 31,284 -> 24,770: 6,514 lines gone, 21%.
#
# Three things moved to where they belonged rather than travelling with
# the handlers. read_net_stat() and container_veth_host_name() went to
# network.c -- both are network facts about a name and both were needed
# by the network handlers and the container ones alike.
# network_error_to_status(), the pure enum-to-status resolver, is
# exported, because create_container_from_body() validates its networks
# array before it has an fd to answer on.
#
# test_lint caught its fourth defect of this refactor and this one
# could not be fixed like the third: network.h now declares a struct
# registry_entry * parameter, and registry.h already includes
# network.h, so including it back would have been circular. A forward
# declaration is the right answer.
#
# dhcp was examined and deliberately left: its block reaches into boot
# and dns, and it depends on create_container_persisted() and a rolling
# restart timer re-arm. Knowing when to stop is the rule working.

	# #296: prove the new console-input scenario actually catches the
	# bug it was written for.
	#
	# The selftest above ran test_console_exec, which now includes an
	# INPUT scenario: it writes a keystroke as a binary websocket frame
	# and requires a real exec'd process to echo it back. A pass proves
	# nothing on its own -- the whole reason #294 shipped is that this
	# file was green while the console ignored every keystroke.
	#
	# v2.53.60 tried to prove it by DELETING the memset, and the test
	# still passed, so that build correctly failed. The reason is worth
	# keeping: not zeroing a malloc() only reproduces #294 when the
	# memory happens to be non-zero, and fresh kernel pages are zeroed,
	# so pty_out_len came up 0 and the code worked. That is also why
	# #294 was environment-dependent rather than constant.
	#
	# So the struct is POISONED instead of merely left unzeroed, which
	# is what uninitialised memory actually looked like on the host that
	# hit this: every field the code below assigns is still assigned,
	# and every field it forgot -- pty_out_len, the buffer -- is
	# garbage. That is exactly #294.
