#
# v2.57.17: the documentation audit, and the gate that keeps it.
#
# No daemon behaviour changes. This exists to compile and run the new
# test_docindex check, which is in SELFTESTS -- a defect in it would
# fail every future release build, not only the change that introduced
# it, so it is verified deliberately rather than discovered by whoever
# builds next.
#
# The check enforces the ADR header schema: the H1 shape, that a
# "## Status" heading exists, and that its first word is one of
# ADR-0000's declared statuses -- and deliberately nothing about the
# prose after it, since "Accepted; phased." says something a bare token
# cannot. Its rules were validated against all 267 ADRs and against
# deliberately broken copies of each drift type before this build.

	# #296: prove the new console-input scenario actually catches the
	# bug it was written for.
	#
	# The selftest above ran test_console_exec, which now includes an
	# INPUT scenario: it writes a keystroke as a binary websocket frame
	# and requires a real exec'd process to echo it back. A pass proves
	# nothing on its own -- the whole reason #294 shipped is that this
	# file was green while the console ignored every keystroke.
	#
	# v2.53.60 tried to prove it by DELETING the memset, and the test
	# still passed, so that build correctly failed. The reason is worth
	# keeping: not zeroing a malloc() only reproduces #294 when the
	# memory happens to be non-zero, and fresh kernel pages are zeroed,
	# so pty_out_len came up 0 and the code worked. That is also why
	# #294 was environment-dependent rather than constant.
	#
	# So the struct is POISONED instead of merely left unzeroed, which
	# is what uninitialised memory actually looked like on the host that
	# hit this: every field the code below assigns is still assigned,
	# and every field it forgot -- pty_out_len, the buffer -- is
	# garbage. That is exactly #294.
